You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.

			In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making.

			</p>

			<p class="font-light text-justify text-gray-500 md:text-lg xl:text-sm dark:text-gray-400">

			9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
			</p>

			<p class="font-light text-justify text-gray-500 md:text-lg xl:text-sm dark:text-gray-400">
			Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
			</p>

			<p class="font-light text-justify text-gray-500 md:text-lg xl:text-sm dark:text-gray-400">
			California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
